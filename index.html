        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Phone Cleaner App</p>
    </header>
    <main>
        <p>Thank you for choosing to use our Phone Cleaner App (hereinafter referred to as "this App" or "App"). We attach great importance to your privacy and personal information protection, and hereby formulate this Privacy Policy to explain to you how we collect, use, protect and share your information. Please note that this App can be used without registration. We are committed to minimizing the collection and processing of your personal information while providing efficient cleaning services.</p>

        <h2>1. Information Collection</h2>
        <p><strong>Non-personal information collection:</strong> In order to optimize the application functions and enhance the user experience, we may collect some non-personal information, such as device model, operating system version, device ID, general region, application usage (such as cleaning task type, execution frequency), etc. This information cannot be directly associated with a specific personal identity.</p>

        <p><strong>Permission request:</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Image and video cleaning:</strong> When cleaning pictures and videos, the App needs to access your media library permission. We only use this permission to identify and clean the files you select, and will not upload or analyze any content.</li>
            <li><strong>Speaker cleaning:</strong> The speaker cleaning function may involve audio playback permissions to ensure that the test sound can be played normally. This process does not involve any personal information collection.</li>
            <li><strong>Phonebook cleanup:</strong> If you choose to use the phonebook cleanup feature, the app will request access to your contact list. We only use this permission to help you identify and clean up duplicate or unnecessary contact information, and will not collect, store or share your contact data.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>2. Information Use</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Service provision:</strong> The information we collect is mainly used to provide and improve the services of this app, including but not limited to the cleaning functions of pictures, videos, speakers and phonebooks.</li>
            <li><strong>Performance analysis:</strong> We may use the collected non-personal information for application performance analysis to optimize the user experience, but this process will not be associated with any personal identity.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>3. Information Sharing</h2>
        <p>We promise not to sell, rent or illegally provide your personal information to third parties (due to the registration-free feature of this app, personal information is not actually collected). However, we may share non-personal information in the following circumstances:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Share with service providers so that they can provide us with infrastructure services (such as server hosting, data analysis, etc.), but these service providers must comply with strict confidentiality agreements.</li>
            <li>Comply with legal and regulatory requirements, or respond to legitimate requests from government departments.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>4. User Rights</h2>
        <p>You have the right to stop using this app at any time, and can manage app permissions through device settings, including revoking specific permission authorizations for this app.</p>

        <h2>5. Privacy Policy Updates</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy based on changes in laws and regulations or business needs. We will inform you of any major changes through in-app notifications or other appropriate means. Please check this Privacy Policy regularly to learn the latest content.</p>

        <h2>6. Contact Information</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:wshuang302@gmail.com">wshuang302@gmail.com</a>.</p>

        <p>Please note that the above privacy policy template is for reference only, and the specific terms should be adjusted and improved according to actual business needs and local laws and regulations.</p>
